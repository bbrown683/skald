# Skald
A programming language built using ANTLR4 and BCEL that compiles to JVM bytecode. More of a personal learning experience than anything else.
The language aims to take features from languages I like and combine them.

### Desired Features
- C# Async/Await, LINQ, Properties, Events/Delegates
- F# Union Types
- C++ Operator Overloading

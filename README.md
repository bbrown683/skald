# Jasper
A language built using ANTLR4 and BCEL that compiles to JVM bytecode. 
The language aims to take features from languages I like and combine them into one language. The language is still in development and is not yet usable.

### Desired Features
- C# Async/Await, LINQ, Properties, Events/Delegates
- F# Union Types
- C++ Operator Overloading

# Lang
A language built using ANTLR4 that compiles to JVM bytecode. 
The language aims to take features from languages I like and combine them into one language. The language is still in development and is not yet usable.

### Desired C# Features
- C# LINQ, Properties, Events/Delegates
- F# Discriminated Unions
